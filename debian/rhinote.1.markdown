# NAME

Rhinote - virtual sticky-notes for your desktop

# SYNOPSIS

rhinote

# DESCRIPTION

`Rhinote` is a simple program that provides virtual sticky-notes for your
desktop. It's handy for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text
that you plan to past elsewhere later.

Notes can be saved as plain text for later viewing/editing with `Rhinote`
or any other text editor. 

`Rhinote` is designed to be "keyboard friendly", that is, every single
action is bound to a specific keystroke.
